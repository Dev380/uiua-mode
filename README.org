* uiua-mode

This is an emacs mode for [[https://www.uiua.org][Uiua]], an array language.

Since the language's semantics and syntax are still
very much in flux, the mode will change as well.

Please report any divergence from the major/minor releases of uiua
as Github issues. They are considered bugs.

** Setup

Users with an Emacs that supports treesitter should prefer [[https://github.com/crmsnbleyd/uiua-ts-mode][uiua-ts-mode]].

Otherwise, to use this conventional major mode:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package uiua-mode
    :mode "\\.ua\\'"
    :ensure t)  ; or :straight t if using straight.el
#+end_src
