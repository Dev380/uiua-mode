This is an emacs mode for [[https://www.uiua.org][Uiua]], an array language

Much like the language itself, this mode is currently in progress

** Setup
There are two major modes: one which uses tree-sitter, and one which does not.
The latter is meant for emacs versions without treesitter capabilities,
Users with access to tree-sitter should not prefer it.
To use without tree-sitter
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package uiua-mode
    :mode "\\.ua\\'"
    :straight
    (uiua-mode
     :type git :host github
     :repo "crmsnbleyd/uiua-mode"))
#+end_src
To use with tree-sitter
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package uiua-mode
    :mode ("\\.ua\\'" . uiua-ts-mode)
    :straight
    (uiua-mode
     :type git :host github
     :repo "crmsnbleyd/uiua-mode"))
#+end_src
Upon loading a .ua file, emacs will complain about not finding the grammar.
Simply type ~M-x treesit-install-language-grammar~ then ~uiua~ to install it.
